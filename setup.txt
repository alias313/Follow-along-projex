After activating your environment in your terminal execute the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt

REMEMBER to do this inside the folder where requirements.txt is located.

If you are running these programs from the terminal execute them from the correct folder (Multi-Clipboard, Weather_Fetcher...)

Also, you must input your own API key from openweather in the Weather_Fetcher project.
Add a .json file named "api.json" and input a key named "key" and store the API key provided by OpenWeather inside.
DO NOT share this API key with anyone
