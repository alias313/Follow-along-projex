# Follow-along-projex
This repository will contain the projects that I've followed a tutorial for in hope of learning more about a specific programming language or technology.

## For the python projects:
After activating your virtual environment in your terminal execute the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**REMEMBER** to do this inside the folder where requirements.txt is located.

If you are running these programs from the terminal execute them from the correct folder (Multi-Clipboard, Weather_Fetcher...)

### API Weather program
You must input your own API key generated from your OpenWeather account in the Weather_Fetcher project.

**DO NOT** share this API key with anyone
Add a .json file named "api.json" and input a key named "key" and store the API key provided by OpenWeather as the value of the key as such:

```
{
    "key": "your api key"
}
```
